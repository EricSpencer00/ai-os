# Quick Fix Reference

## Problem
x11vnc service failing: `Fatal server error: Unrecognized option: &`

## Root Cause
Systemd doesn't support shell operators like `&` in ExecStartPre

## Solution
Wrap command in bash shell:
```bash
ExecStartPre=/bin/bash -c 'Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1280x720x24 -ac -nolisten tcp &'
```

## File Changed
- `auraos.sh` Line 662

## Verification
```bash
# Check service status
multipass exec auraos-multipass -- systemctl status auraos-x11vnc.service

# Should show: Active: active (running)
```

## Access Point
- Web: http://localhost:6080/vnc.html
- Password: auraos123
- Direct VNC: localhost:5900
